    <h1>Dom :- accessing HTML elements using javascript</h1>
    <p>The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.</p>
    <p>Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.</p>
